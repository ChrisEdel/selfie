## A Hybrid Symbolic Execution and Bounded Model Checking Engine in Selfie (Christian Edelmayer, 2019)

In a world dependent on software, it is of the utmost importance to ensure the correctness of that software. For this reason, software needs to be analyzed. In this thesis, the software analysis methods called symbolic execution and bounded model checking are explained in detail. Furthermore, a hybrid symbolic execution and bounded model checking engine was implemented in Selfie. It is outlined thoroughly how the symbolic execution engine was extended into the hybrid engine. The main challenge was to implement the merging of paths which corresponds to bounded model checking. Our experiments show that symbolic execution produces formulas which can be solved more easily at the cost of a slower translation time. Exactly the opposite is true for bounded model checking. In other words, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages.
